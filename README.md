Latex classes for IACR publications.

Currently, this serves as the main repository for the [iacrcc LaTeX class](https://github.com/IACR/latex/tree/main/iacrcc) as used by the [IACR Communications in Cryptology](https://cic.iacr.org/).

Note that this depends upon cryptobib as a git submodule. Submodules are tricky. If
you want to pull in the latest version of the submodule, use

```
git submodule update --remote --rebase
```
