# The iacrj LaTeX document class

The iacrj.cls document class is used for journals that are published
by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). This
currently includes three journals:
* IACR Communications in Cryptology
* IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology
* IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems.

The iacrj.cls document class is intended as a replacement for
both iacrcc.cls and iacrtrans.cls. This document class depends upon
the `metacapture.sty` package, which is available in CTAN and
at https://publish.iacr.org/iacrj.

The documentation for the iacrj.cls is contained in iacrj-doc.tex and
iacrj-doc.pdf. There is additionally a sample file iacrj-template.tex
that can be used to create articles for the journals.

Bugs can be reported at the github repository: https://github.com/IACR/latex
and questions can be sent to iacrj (at) iacr.org.
