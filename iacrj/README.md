# The iacrj LaTeX document class

The iacrj.cls document class is used for journals that are published
by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). This
currently includes three journals:
* IACR Communications in Cryptology
* IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology
* IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems.

The iacrj.cls document class is intended as a replacement for
both iacrcc.cls and iacrtrans.cls.

The documentation for the iacrj.cls is contained in iacrj-doc.tex and
iacrj-doc.pdf. There is additionally a sample file iacrj-template.tex
that can be used to create articles for the journals.

The iacrj.cls document class has several external dependencies, but
the most important is the metacapture.sty package. Bugs on both can be
reported at the shared repository: https://github.com/IACR/latex
