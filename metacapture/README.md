# What is this?

This directory contains the source code for two LaTeX packages:

1. the metacapture.sty package that can be used by a document class to provide
   metadata capture. This includes the following files:
   * metacapture.sty
   * metadoc.tex (the documentation)
   * metacapture.sty.ltxml (an implementation for LaTeXML)
   * sample.tex (a sampler that be used to view features)
2. the `iacrj.cls` document class. This is a replacement for both `iacrcc.cls`
   and `iacrtrans.cls`, and can be used for producing articles for the IACR
   journals CiC, TOSC, and TCHES. This requires metacapture.sty, and consists of
   two files:
   * iacrj.cls (the document class)
   * iacrdoc.tex (the documentation)
