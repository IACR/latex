  This is documentation for the iacrj.cls document class that can

  CiC. The iacrj document class is intended to supercede

\section*{Introduction}

This document is a guide to using the \texttt{iacrj} document class for
three IACR journals:
\begin{itemize}
\item IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC),
\item IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES),
\item IACR Communications in Cryptology (CiC)
\end{itemize}
The \texttt{iacrj.cls} class is intended to replace both
\href{https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/iacrtrans}{\texttt{iacrtrans}}
and \href{https://github.com/IACR/latex/iacrcc}{\texttt{iacrcc}}.

The biggest difference between \texttt{iacrj} and
\texttt{iacrtrans} is the way that metadata is supplied by authors.
Rather than using the \cmd{author} macro to enclose all author names,
each author is added with a \cmd{addauthor} macro. The macros for
supplying metadata are defined in the
companion \texttt{metacapture.sty}
\LaTeX\ style file. The \texttt{metacapture.sty} package is \href{metadoc.pdf}{documented separately},
but that documentation is mostly of interest to designers of
other \LaTeX\ document classes.

The class is still in development and feedback and comments are
welcome.  The latest version can be found at:
\href{https://publish.iacr.org/iacrj}{\texttt{publish.iacr.org/iacrj}}.
There is also a \href{https://github.com/IACR/iacrj}{github
repository} where you can open issues or to submit pull requests.
The complete package consists of four files. \texttt{iacrj.cls} is
the main document class that loads the \texttt{metacapture.sty}
package. \texttt{iacrdoc.tex} is used to produce this PDF
file. \texttt{template.tex} can be used as a starting point for
writing an article for ToSC, TCHES, or CiC. The only difference
between these is that there is a \texttt{journal} argument
in \cmd{documentclass}.

\paragraph*{NOTES}
\begin{itemize}
\item The production system to which you submit your final version requires
  that the main \LaTeX\ file should be \texttt{main.tex}. You might as
  well start that way by copying \texttt{template.tex} to \texttt{main.tex}.
\item The default fonts are provided by the document class. Please do not
  change this.
\item Avoid using too many packages. Many authors are lazy and just
  copy what they used in the past. This is a very bad habit, and some
  pckages either won't work or need to be loaded in a prescribed
  order. See the list of acceptable packages
  at \url{https://publish.iacr.org}.
\item Don't try to change the \texttt{hyperref} options, the bibliography style,
  the page style, or the page numbering.
\item Don't use macros like \cmd{if} or \cmd{include} inside any
  metadata like the title or abstract.
\item Footnotes are handled differently in this class, and in
  particular \cmd{thanks} is disabled.
\end{itemize}

\section{Invocation and usage}

The class supports the following class options with \verb+\documentclass{iacrj}+
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{[journal=tosc]}] is used to select formatting for ToSC,
\texttt{[journal=tches]} is used for TCHES, and \texttt{[journal=cic]}
is used for CiC. One of these must be specified.
\item[\texttt{[version=preprint]}] for preprints (without copyright info, default)
\item[\texttt{[version=submission]}] for submissions (anonymous, with
  line numbers).  If desired, this can be combined with
  \texttt{[notanonymous]} if the call for papers requires
  non-anonymous submissions.
\item[\texttt{[version=final]}] for final papers. This imposes some
  additional requirements like a license and a text-only abstract
  in the \texttt{textabstract} environment.
\item[\texttt{[biblatex]}] may be used if you prefer using
  \BibLaTeX\ to \BibTeX. Note that we do not support options to be
  passed to \BibLaTeX, as they may conflict with the style of the journal. We use
  a bibliography style based on the alpha style (e.g., \cite{RSA78}).
\item[\texttt{[floatrow]}] load the \texttt{floatrow} package. This is useful
  when you have fancy figures or tables. In either case, \texttt{iacrj}
  will customize how tables and figures are laid out.
\end{description}

The current date of compilation time is automatically added to the
footer of the front page. If you want to adjust this date you can
use the \verb+\documentdate+ macro (e.g. \verb+\documentdate{2023-10-05}+)
or use \verb+\documentdate{}+ to omit adding the date.

The \texttt{iacrj} class automatically loads \texttt{hyperref}
after all other packages.  If you need some packages like \texttt{cleveref}
to be loaded \emph{after} \texttt{hyperref}, you should read Section~\ref{sec:loadorder}.

\section{Macros to add title and author information}

\subsection{Title}
A title is added using the \cmd{title} macro, it has a number of optional arguments:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
    {\tt running}   & The running title displayed in the headers.\\
    {\tt plaintext} & A text version of the title. This is required if you use macros in the
    main argument to the \cmd{title} macro.\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent An example using all the optional arguments would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\title[running   = {How to use the iacrj class},
       plaintext = {How to use the iacrj LaTeX class}
      ]{How to use the \texttt{iacrj} \LaTeX\ class}
\end{verbatim}
The \verb+plaintext+ option is only required if you use macros in your
title (it is required in the example because the \cmd{LaTeX}
and \cmd{texttt} macros are used). Inline mathematics and accents
like \verb+\"u+ are allowed in plain text. Note that \LaTeX\ has
defaulted to UTF-8 input since 2019, so just Ã¼ is preferred
to \verb+\"u+. Note that both \verb+\thanks+ and \verb+\footnote+ are
disabled because footnotes are forbidden on titles. You may instead
use the \cmd{genericfootnote} macro described in
section~\ref{footnotes}.  The \verb+running+ option is only required
if the title does not fit on a single line in the header.

This is a good time to explain why plaintext versions are
required. These are used by the journal production system that must
produce titles for various other purposes. Examples include the
registration of the DOI with \texttt{crossref.org}, the production of
RSS and OAI-PMH, the indexing of your article with search engines, and
the creation of HTML pages for your article.

\subsection{Subtitle}
An author is always allowed to have a two-line title by inserting a
newline \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash} into the main argument
of \cmd{title}, but some authors may instead want a ``subtitle''
that is typeset in a smaller font under the title.
This can be accomplished with the \cmd{subtitle} macro.
This also takes an optional \texttt{plaintext} attribute if the main argument
to \cmd{subtitle} contains any macros.  A full example could be:
\begin{Verbatim}[samepage=true]
\subtitle[plaintext={A LaTeX tutorial}]{%
     A \LaTeX\ tutorial\protect\footnote{Thanks to Leslie Lamport}}
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Authors}
Author information is entered using the \verb+\addauthor+,
\verb+\addaffiliation+, and \verb+\addfunding+ macros. Authors are asked
to enter this information in a structured way so that we can provide
it to indexing agencies. The \verb+\author+ macro is disabled.

Authors are listed individually using repeated calls to the {\tt
\textbackslash{}addauthor} command.  There are a number of
optional arguments to {\tt \textbackslash{}addauthor}:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
    {\tt inst}     & A numerical list of indices specifying an institution in the 
                     affiliation array (see below). These are used as footnote symbols
                     to link to affiliations.\\
    {\tt orcid}    & Create a small clickable orcid logo next to the authors name 
                     looking like \orcidlink{0000-0003-1010-8157} and linking to 
		     the authors ORCID (see: \url{https://orcid.org}).\\
    {\tt footnote} & Create an author-specific footnote. The \cmd{footnote} macro
    is disabled inside the \cmd{addauthor} macro.\\
    {\tt surname}  & Indicate the surname of the author for indexing purposes.\\
    {\tt onclick}  & Creates a symbol \linkicon\ displayed next to the author name
    that is a clickable link to a URL that is supplied in the argument. This may be
    used for a link to a person web page. Links to web pages can also be specified
    in the \texttt{footnote} argument with the \cmd{url} macro, but authors should be
    formatted in a consistent way.\\
    {\tt email}    & Define the e-mail address of this author. Note that at least
    one e-mail address is required when \texttt{[version=final]} is used.\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent We \textbf{strongly} recommend that authors enter their
ORCID ID into the paper, because this ensures that they will get
citation credit for their papers. Authors can use the \texttt{surname}
argument to indicate what part of the author name is the surname. This
is used only for metadata processing, and is especially useful for
cases with middle names \emph{and/or} double surnames which might be
confusing.

When the URL provided to the {\tt onclick} option contain characters
with a ``special'' meaning in \LaTeX{} they might render incorrectly.
An example with some of the common characters \string~, \%, and \# is
\begin{verbatim}
  onclick = {https://www.webpage.com/\string~\%\#/}
\end{verbatim}
\noindent which displays \authorlink{https://www.webpage.com/\string~\%\#/}
next to the author name.

An example of \cmd{addauthor} using all the optional arguments is given below. In this case
the author has \verb+inst={1,2}+ to indicate that they are affiliated with
the first and second affiliations that are entered later with
\verb+\addaffiliation+:

\begin{verbatim}
\addauthor[orcid    = {0000-0000-0000-0000},
           inst     = {1,2},
           footnote = {Thanks to my supervisor for the support.},
           onclick  = {https://www.mypersonalwebpage.com},
           email    = {alice@accomplished.com},
           surname  = {Accomplished},
          ]{Alice Accomplished}
\end{verbatim}
The \cmd{thanks} macro is disabled inside \cmd{addauthor}, so
the \verb+footnote+ option on \cmd{addauthor} should be used instead.

The author names displayed in the header are constructed automatically, but
if this extends to more than one line, you should use the
\cmd{authorrunning} macro to define a list of authors in the header. You can
use ``et al'' to abbreviate the list, or use only surnames, or you can
simply set it to an empty string to omit the author list in the
header.

\subsection{Affiliations}
Affiliations are listed individually using the \cmd{addaffiliation} command
\emph{after} the last author has been added using \cmd{addauthor}.
There are a number of optional arguments to \cmd{addaffiliation}:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
    {\tt ror}         & Provide the Research Organization Registry (ROR) indentifier
                        for this affiliation (see: \url{https://ror.org}). 
                        This is used for meta-data collection only.\\
    {\tt  department} & Department or suborganization name.\\
    {\tt  street}     & Street address.\\
    {\tt  city}       & City name.\\
    {\tt  state}      & State or province name.\\
    {\tt  postcode}   & Zip or postal code.\\
    {\tt  country}    & Country name. Required if \texttt{[version=final]} is used in the document options.\\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent There is an online tool at
\href{https://publish.iacr.org/funding}{\texttt{publish.iacr.org/funding}}
to help you find ROR identifiers, and you are strongly urged to
include these so that grant agencies and employers will be notified when an article
appears with the appropriate ROR id. The \verb+city+ and \verb+country+ arguments are used
to display the affliation. An example using all the optional arguments would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\addaffiliation[ror        = {05f950310},
                department = {Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography},
                street     = {Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, box 2452},
                city       = {Leuven},
                state      = {Vlaams-Brabant},
                postcode   = {3001},
                country    = {Belgium}
               ]{KU Leuven}
\end{verbatim}           

\subsection{Funding information}
Authors should use the \texttt{\textbackslash addfunding} macro to
make sure that funding agencies can find papers published under their
sponsorship. An example is:
\begin{verbatim}
\addfunding[fundref = {100000001},
            grantid = {CNS-1237235},
            country = {United States}]{National Science Foundation}
\addfunding[ror     = {00pn5a327},
            country = {United States}]{Rambus}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent In this example, the author acknowledges a grant from the
National Science Foundation and support from Rambus (with no
\texttt{grantid}). The inclusion of funding from an agency without a
\texttt{grantid} might be appropriate if the author simply received
support for a visit.

The complete list of optional arguments for \texttt{\textbackslash addfunding} is:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
    {\tt fundref} & An identifier from the
                    \href{https://publish.iacr.org/funding}{Crossref funder registry}.\\
    {\tt ror}     & An identifier from the 
                    \href{https://publish.iacr.org/funding}{Research Organization Registry} 
                    (ROR). A \texttt{fundref} identifier is preferred 
                    for \texttt{\textbackslash addfunding}.\\
    {\tt country} & The country of the funding agency. \\
    {\tt grantid} & The identifier of the grant that is assigned by the agency 
                    who provided it.
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
\noindent You can use the online tool at 
\href{https://publish.iacr.org/funding}{\texttt{publish.iacr.org/funding}} to
help you find \texttt{fundref} and \texttt{ror} identifiers.

Note that \cmd{addfunding} \textbf{does not} automatically create footnotes or
an acknowledgements section to identify funding - it only collects the
metadata for indexing. If you wish to include such visible
annotations, you can use the \texttt{footnote} option on
\cmd{addauthor}, or the \cmd{genericfootnote}, or add a separate
acknowledgements section. Some funding agencies have specific
requirements for how they want to be acknowledged in the paper.

\subsection{Footnotes}\label{footnotes}
Authors may be accustomed to using \cmd{thanks} for footnotes
indicating affiliation, email, or funding, but the
\cmd{thanks} macro is disabled and you should use other methods described
in this document.
\begin{itemize}
\item Footnotes on titles are not supported. You should use 
  \cmd{genericfootnote} to place a
  footnote on the first page without a reference. This is useful to
  indicate this is a full / extended version of a published paper, or to
  indicate funding relationships for the authors.  This is an optional
  macro that may be repeated for multiple footnotes.
\item For a footnote on an author, use the \texttt{footnote} option
  on \cmd{addauthor}. This can be used for indicating that the author's
  affiliation for the work was different than their current affiliation,
  or to indicate contact address, or a previous name, etc.
\end{itemize}

Footnotes may be used elsewhere in the paper, but please do not
overuse them.

\subsection{License}
When the \texttt{version=final} document mode is used, the author needs
to provide a supported license.  In all other modes this information
is not required and is ignored if it is provided.  At present the only
acceptable license is \texttt{CC-by}.  An example would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\license{CC-by}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Keywords}
Use \texttt{\textbackslash keywords\{keyword1, keyword2\}} to give a
list of keywords or key phrases. This is an optional macro that should
appear before the abstract.  Individual keywords should be separated
by commas. If the argument to \texttt{\textbackslash keywords}
contains math or macros, then you must supply an additional set of
text-only keywords; for example:

\texttt{\textbackslash keywords[rings, arithmetic on Z]\{rings, arithmetic on \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\$\}}

\subsection{Abstract}
Abstracts serve several purposes in a journal article, including both
summarization and indexing. An abstract should be a self-contained
mini-document that describes the contributions of the paper. It
should be free of bibliographic references and also free of undefined
terminology introduced in the paper. It is acceptable to use
mathematical notation, but this kind of content is not useful for
indexing.

For this reason, the \texttt{iacrj} document class uses two kinds
of abstracts. The first (traditional) form of abstract is entered with the
\texttt{abstract} environment as usual.  Note that the keywords should
be given before starting the \texttt{abstract} environment.

For \texttt{final} versions of papers, an additional ``text-only''
abstract is required. This abstract is contained in the
\texttt{textabstract} environment, and should not contain
user-defined macros.
It will be used for indexing and production of
{HTML} pages to describe the paper. As such, it is just as important
as the classical \texttt{abstract} of a paper because it contains a
textual summary that readers will use to decide if the paper is worth
reading. The only difference is that the contents of the
\texttt{textabstract} is constrained on what it may contain.

You may use unicode such as in \verb+Paul ErdÅs+ or
diacriticals like \verb+F\"ur Elise+.
You may also use inline or display mathematics
in the \texttt{textabstract} environment as well as
(for example) the  \texttt{itemize} environment.
User-defined macros are \emph{not} allowed.
We do not have a complete list of allowed
\LaTeX (which can be succesfully converted to HTML) but
but you will find out when you upload your final version
at \url{https://publish.iacr.org}.

The contents of this environment will be written to a file that ends
with \texttt{.abstract} when you compile your \LaTeX, but will not be
displayed in the final PDF except as metadata. Note that
\verb+\begin{textabstract}+ must appear on a line by itself.

\subsection{Theorems}

The \texttt{iacrj} class uses the \AmS{} packages to typeset
math.  In particular, it loads the \texttt{amsthm} package, and
predefines the following environments:
\begin{center}
  \ttfamily
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}l@{\hspace{1cm}}l}
theorem     & definition & remark \\
proposition & example    & note   \\
problem     & exercise   & case   \\
lemma       & property   &        \\
conjecture  & question   &        \\
corollary   & solution   &        \\
claim       &            &        \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that the \texttt{proof} environment automatically adds a QED
symbol at the end of the proof.
If the QED symbol
is typeset at a wrong position, you can force its position with
\verb+\qedhere+.

\section{Auxiliary files}
One goal of the \texttt{iacrj.cls}
  file is to automate the production of machine-readable metadata in
  separate files. Users of \LaTeX\ will already be used to seeing this
  with the \texttt{.log}, \texttt{.aux}, \texttt{.bbl}, \texttt{.blg},
  \texttt{.toc}, and \texttt{.out} files produced by \BibTeX\ 
  and the \texttt{hyperref} package.  You need not be concerned about
  these, but if your main \LaTeX\ file is called \texttt{main.tex},
  then the extra files that are produced are:
\begin{itemize}
\item a flat text file \texttt{main.meta} containing all metadata
  from the paper.  When you compile
  \texttt{main.tex}, it will produce the metadata from
  \texttt{main.tex}, and when you run \texttt{bibtex} and
  \texttt{latex} again, it will append the citation data from
  \BibTeX into the \texttt{main.meta} file as well.
\item a file \texttt{main.abstract} that contains
  the contents of the abstract for the paper provided with the
  \texttt{textabstract} environment. This will be used to show
  the abstract on the web.
\end{itemize}

\section{Typesetting the Bibliography}
\label{sec:biblio}

Having good bibliographic references is very important for the
visibility of the journal.  Since we don't use a commercial editor,
authors need to make sure themselves that references are standardized
and clean.  We strongly encourage authors to use bibliographic data
from \url{http://www.dblp.org} or \url{https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/}.
All references should have DOIs if at all possible.

You must use either \BibTeX\ or \BibLaTeX; you may not format your own bibliography.
If you use \BibTeX, then the \texttt{iacrj} class will load the
\verb+\bibliographystyle{alphaurl}+ style.  You may not change
this. If you use \BibLaTeX, then this is done using
\verb+\documentclass[biblatex]{iacrj}+ instead of
\verb+\usepackage{biblatex}+; the latter will generate an error
because the \texttt{iacrj.cls} file loads \BibLaTeX\ with a
specific style.

Here are some example citations: the RSA paper~\cite{RSA78}, the AES
standard~\cite{AES-FIPS}, and \cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/Kocher96}.

For the IACR Communications in Cryptology, you will be required to
upload your \BibTeX\ files rather than just the \texttt{bbl} file.
Many authors use the \texttt{cryptobib} \BibTeX\ files, and you need
not upload those with your paper. They can be referenced as
\texttt{\textbackslash bibliography\{cryptobib/abbrev1,cryptobib/crypto\}}

\section{Package load order}\label{sec:loadorder}

\LaTeX\ suffers from the weakness of having a global namespace for
macros. As a result, it is possible that some packages may overwrite
the definitions of another package that was loaded earlier. The
biggest offender for this seems to be the \texttt{hyperref} package,
which overwrites some basic macros in \LaTeX\ itself. The
\texttt{iacrj} document class loads \texttt{hyperref}, but it
provides a mechanism for loading packages \emph{after} \texttt{hyperref}. If
the file \texttt{after-hyperref.sty} exists in the directory of your
main file, then it will be included after loading \texttt{hyperref}.
As an example, to load \texttt{cleveref} after \texttt{hyperref}, you
can create a file \texttt{after-hyperref.sty} that contains:
\begin{verbatim}
\RequirePackage{cleveref}
\end{verbatim}
A complete survey of the conflicts between packages is beyond the scope of this document, but
some known conflicts between packages are documented in the
\href{https://github.com/mhelvens/latex-pkgloader/blob/master/pkgloader-recommended.sty}{\texttt{pkgloader}}
package. It is wise to read the documentation for any package you use to make sure
there are no conflicts with other packages loaded by \texttt{iacrj.cls}.

\section{Some recommendations}\label{sec:options}

\paragraph{\LaTeX{} distribution, and worklow.}  \LaTeX{}
distributions are available on a variety of platforms.  In particular,
we recommend the \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}
distribution, which is updated regularly, includes a large number of
packages, and is available on many platforms. We use the texlive medium
scheme in our cloud service to compile final versions of papers.

\paragraph{Pictures.}
We recommend the use of the \texttt{tikz} package to render pictures.
In particular, a large variety of crypto pictures made with
\texttt{tikz} is available at \href{http://iacr.org/authors/tikz/}{\texttt{iacr.org/authors/tikz/}}

\paragraph{External pictures.}  The \texttt{graphicx} is loaded by the
class, and is recommended for external figures. The submission server
does not support \texttt{svg} format for included graphics, so you
should convert \texttt{svg} files to a supported format.  If possible,
external figures should be in a vector format (PDF or EPS).  Note that
the \verb+\includegraphics+ command will automatically select a file
with what it thinks should be the right extension, so if you write
\verb+\includegraphics{figure}+ and have two files \texttt{figure.gif}
and \texttt{figure.eps}, it will try to select the correct one.

\paragraph{Floats.}
Figure captions should be below the figures, and table captions above
the tables.  The \texttt{float} package loaded by the class should
take care of this automatically.  If want to have several figures side
by side, see the \texttt{[floatrow]} option.

\paragraph{Tables.}
We recommend the \texttt{booktabs} package to typeset tables.

\paragraph{Algorithms.}
We recommend the \texttt{algorithmicx} packages for algorithms (in
particular, \texttt{algpseudocodex} for pseudo-code).
