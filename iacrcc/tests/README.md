# Tests for iacrcc.cls

This directory contains code and data for testing iacrcc.cls. There
is a main driver `compile_tests.py` that contains all of the tests
(though they could be broken up differently). These tests use
whatever TeX environment you have installed, so that they may not
reflect what happens in the submission server itself. Tests
for the submission server itself are in the latex-submit repository.

In order to run tests, you need to have `pytest` and a latex environment
installed. In order to run all tests, use
```
pytest compile_tests.py -vv
```
The `-vv` argument produces more verbose output, which is useful
if a test fails. You can also try just `-v`.

These tests are quite slow, so you may want to run only one.
In order to run a single test, use:
```
pytest compile_tests.py::test1_test -vv
```
This will run only `test1_test()` in `compile_tests.py`.
