%%%% 6. PAPER CONTENT %%%%
\section{Introduction}

Widely used primitives like the AES~\cite{AES} do not have perfect
security, and can be analysed with linear
cryptanalysis~\cite{EC:Matsui93}, differential
cryptanalysis~\cite{JC:BihSha91}, or differential power
analysis~\cite{C:KocJafJun99}.  We show that the One-Time-Pad is
unconditionally secure in \autoref{sec:main}.
