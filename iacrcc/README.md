# IACR Communications on Cryptology

## ðŸ”§ This is a work in progress ðŸ”§

This directory contains `iacrcc.cls` and `iacrcc.bst` for processing
of articles submitted to the new IACR Communications on Cryptology
journal.  The user documentation is contained in example.tex, and this
README currently holds only development details. 

The purpose of this style is to facilitate proper capture of author metadata
for the publication editing workflow. Typically a LaTeX class is concerned with
only the layout of the document, but we have added some additional requirements:
1. when the user runs pdflatex/bibtex/pdflatex on their document, it
   should produce a parsable text file that contains structured metadata about
   the paper, including title, authors, their affiliations, and the paper citations.
2. the author should only have to enter this metadata once, in properly formatted
   LaTeX macros that conform to the required cls.

This LaTeX style is based on the previous [iacrtrans](https://github.com/Cryptosaurus/iacrtrans)
class used to ToSC and TCHES. These may be unified in the future.

We perhaps could have written the `.meta` file as `yaml`, but this is
problematic because of special characters like { or \ or ". For this
reason we use a custom parser that looks only at the tags on the line
to decide what the structure is. The format of the file is
hierarchical, and is perhaps best illustrated with an example in which
there are three authors who share three affiliations on a paper with
two references.

The specification of metadata requirements is hopefully readily
apparent from this example. In citations, authors are listed on one
string, but then each author is listed separately along with their
surname.  Due to the fact that LaTeX has trouble producing UTF-8,
names are encoded using TeX codes for accents. The structure is
designed to fulfill the requirements for consumers of metadata about
papers, which is described in a [separate document](METADATA.md).

## Production of metadata.

Note that both `iacrcc.cls` and `iacrcc.bst` are required to be used,
since they work together.  Authors supply their metadata in LaTeX
macros using macros from `iacrcc.cls`. When the author runs `pdflatex
main` on the file `main.tex`, it produces an output `main.meta` that
contains the metadata above, but without the citation fields. When the
author then runs `bibtex main` using `iacrcc.bst`, it produces a
`main.bbl` file that contains extra LaTeX macros to write citation
metadata. When the author runs `pdflatex main` a second time, it
includes the `main.bbl` file to produce the bibliography, but now it
also runs macros to write the citation metadata into `main.meta`. This
is similar to how the `hyperref` package works, by writing a file
`main.out` with bookmark commands.

## Related work

There are a large number of LaTeX styles that attempt to capture strucutred metadata
about authors and affiliations. Some are listed below.

 - [elsarticle](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle?lang=en) They use
   labels to associate affiliations and addresses to authors, but have no example where an
   author has multiple affiliations.
 - [apa7](https://ctan.math.illinois.edu/macros/latex/contrib/apa7/apa7.pdf) uses a
   silly comma separated list, but the mapping from authors to affiliations is many to many as it
   should be.
  Their format is:
  ```
  \authorsnames[1,{2,3},1]{Savannah C. St. John, Fen-Lei Chang, Carlos O. VÃ¡squez III}
  \authorsaffiliations{{Education Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey, ...},
                       {MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit, Cambridge, England},
                       {Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge}}
  ```
  There is no structured information about affiliations (e.g., ROR IDs or addresses).
- [ifac,ifacconf](https://www.ifac-control.org/events/author-guide/copy_of_ifacconf_latex.zip/view)
  does pretty close to what we want, but footnotes are ugly ****
- [authblk](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/authblk) comes close to handling authors the way we want, but
  has no structured data for authors or affiliations.

  does CUP use a different style for each journal?
