% IACR Communications in Cryptology template file
% This file shows how to use the iacrcc class to write a paper.

%% Document mode
% [version=xxx] where xxx is preprint, submission, or final. The default is preprint.
%               version=submission puts line numbers into the document and makes it
%               anonymous (which can be overridden).
%               version=final is for submitting the final version. This requires a license
%               to be specified and must be compiled with lualatex.
% [notanonymous]  Keep author names in submission mode
%% Package options
% [floatrow]      Load floatrow package with correct captions
% [xcolor=xxx]    Pass xxx to xcolor package
% [hyperref=xxx]  Pass xxx to hyperref package
% [biblatex]      Use the biblatex package instead of bibtex. Note that options
%                 may not be passed to biblatex at this time.
\documentclass[version=preprint]{iacrcc}

% When the *final* document mode is used
% the authors need to provide a supported license.
% In all other modes this information is ignored.
% The currently provided ones are { CC-by }
\license{CC-by}

% Include LaTeX packages required by your paper
% \usepackage{}

% Provide the title of the paper
% This should look like:
\title[running  = {The iacrcc class},
       onclick  = {https://github.com/IACR/latex},
       subtitle = {A Template}
      ]{How to Use the IACR Communications in Cryptology Class}
% Where the options in square brackets “[ ]” are optional and control the following:
% running: the running title displayed in the headers
% onclick: define what to do when clicking on the title. 
%          This could be used to point to a webpage associated with this paper. 
% subtitle: provide a subtitle

% Define authors and affiliations
% Authors are listed individually using the \addauthor tag followed by a list of affiliations.
% The idea is that every author makes a separate call to this command.
% This should look like:
% \addauthor[inst      = {1,2},
%            orcid     = 0000-0000-0000-0000,
%            footnote  = {Thanks to my supervisor for the support.},
%            onclick   = {https://www.mypersonalwebpage.com}
%           ]{Alice Accomplished}
% Where the options in square brackets “[ ]” are optional 
% and control the following:
% inst:     a numerical list pointing to the index of the institution 
%           in the affiliation array.
% orcid:    create a small clickable orcid logo next to the authors name 
%           linking to the authors ORCID iD see: orcid.org.
% footnote: create an author-specific footnote.
% onclick:  define what to do when clicking on the author name: 
%           e.g., can point to the academic webpage.
% email:    define the e-mail address of this author.
\addauthor[orcid    = {0000-0003-1010-8157},
           inst     = {1},
           onclick  = {https://www.joppebos.com},
           footnote = {This is an example footnote.},
           email    = {joppe.bos@nxp.com}
          ]{Joppe W. \surname{Bos}}

\addauthor[orcid   = {0000-0001-7890-5430},
           inst    = {2},
           email   = {mccurley@digicrime.com},
          ]{Kevin S. \surname{McCurley}}

% Affiliations are listed individually using the \affiliations command 
% *after* the (list of) authors using \addauthor
% This should look like (full example):
% \affiliation[ror        = 05f950310,
%              onclick    = {http://www.kuleuven.be/english},
%              department = {Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography},              
%              street     = {Kasteelpark Arenberg 10, box 2452},
%              city       = {Leuven},
%              state      = {Vlaams-Brabant},
%              postcode   = {3001},
%              country    = {Belgium}
%             ]{KU Leuven}
% Where the options in square brackets “[ ]” are optional and control 
% the following (optional information is mainly used for meta-data collection):
% ror:        provide the Research Organization Registry (ROR) identifier 
%             for this affiliation (see: ror.org). This is used for meta-data 
%             collection only.
% onclick:    define what to do when clicking on the affiliation name: 
%             e.g., can point to the affiliation webpage.
% department: department or suborganization name
% street:     street address
% city:       city name
% state:      state or province name
% postcode:   zip or postal code
% country:    country name

\affiliation[ror     = 031v4g827,

             city    = {Leuven},

\section{Introduction}
This is the template showing how to use the IACR Communications in Cryptology \LaTeX{} class. 
See the ``How to Use the IACR Communications in Cryptology Class'' for more details.

\section{Bibliography}
Citing papers is done in the usual way using BibTeX or \texttt{biblatex}
commands. For example: the RSA paper~\cite{RSA78}.

It is highly encouraged to use CyptoBib from \url{https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr}

% This sample uses bibtex rather than biblatex.

% - Download abbrev3.bib and crypto.bib from https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/
% - Use bilbio.bib for additional references not in the cryptobib database.
