\section*{Introduction}

The \texttt{iacrcc} \LaTeX{} class is used by the new 
IACR Journal totled ``IACR Communications on Cryptology''.
The class is based on standard \LaTeX{} classes and packages
(mainly the \texttt{article} class with \texttt{amsmath}), and should be
similar in use to the \texttt{llncs} class used for Springer's
proceedings. 
Except for the metadata collection and options related to authors, title and affiliation this 
class file is identical to the IACR Transactions class file (the \texttt{iacrtans} class v. 0.92) 
written by Ga{\"e}tan Leurent and Friedrich Wiemer.

The class is still in development and feedback and comments are welcome.
The latest version can be found on the Github page of the project:
\url{https://github.com/XXX}, feel free to open
tickets for issues or to submit pull requests.

\section{\textcolor{red!70!black}{FAQ}: Frequently Asked Questions}

\iffalse
\subsection{Converting \texttt{llncs} papers to \texttt{iacrtrans} for submission}

If you have a paper typeset with the \texttt{llncs} class, conversion
should be relatively easy.  The following steps should be sufficient
in most cases (for the submission version):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Replace \verb+\documentclass{llncs}+ with\\
    \verb+\documentclass[journal=XXX,submission,spthm]{iacrtrans}+,
    where \verb+XXX+ is either \verb+tosc+, or \verb+tches+;
\item Replace \verb+\bibliographystyle{splncs03}+ with
  \verb+\bibliographystyle{alpha}+;
\item Add a \verb+\keywords{}+ command before the abstract, with
  keywords separated by \verb+\and+;
\item Remove commands that might override the class style, such as
  \verb+\pagestyle{...}+ or \verb+\thispagestyle{...}+,
  change of margins (\emph{e.\,g.}  with the \texttt{geometry} package),
  change of fonts, \ldots
\item See also \autoref{sec:biblio} for information about how to
  typeset the bibliography.
\end{enumerate}
\fi

\subsection{Template file}

There is a \texttt{template.tex} file included with this class, to use
as a starting point for writing a paper.  The \LaTeX{} source of this
documentation can also be used as a more advanced example, but please
make sure to remove any unnecessary code.

\subsection{Preparing the final version}

Before submitting your final version, please make sure that it compiles
properly with the \texttt{[final]} option (see the next subsection in
case of issues), and check that the author names and affiliation are
correct.  In particular, each affiliation MUST be of the form
$\langle\text{institue}\rangle, \langle\text{city}\rangle,
\langle\text{country}\rangle$.

\subsection{Compilation issues}

If your document doesn't compile with the \texttt{iacrcc} class,
you can try adding the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.  This will
disable some code in the class that is known to be fragile, in
particular the generation of metadata.  If this fixes your compilation
problems, please try to define a clean version of \texttt{author}, \texttt{institute},
\texttt{title} and/or \texttt{keywords} as optional arguments to
these commands (in particular, remove \LaTeX{} macros, and write
everything on a single line), and see if you document now compiles
without the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.

\subsection{Line number issues}

In submission mode, the class adds line numbers to help reviewers refer
to specific elements.  Unfortunately, the code that does this is rather
fragile, and some constructions break the line numbering.  In
particular, old-style equations with \verb+$$...$$+ are known to cause
issues, please use \verb+\[...\]+ instead\footnote{For more background
  on \texttt{\$\$...\$\$} and \texttt{\textbackslash[...\textbackslash]},
  see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to}}.

If you find other cases where line numbering is broken, please open a
ticket on github, and we will try to find a solution when possible.
As a quick workaround, you can wrap the offending environment with
\verb+\begin{linenomath}+ / \verb+\end{linenomath}+ (this will do
nothing in preprint or final mode when line numbers are deactivated).

\section{Main Commands}

\subsection{Title page}

The following commands are used to input informations for the title page.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash{}genericfootnote}}
To place a footnote on the first page without a reference (e.g., to indicate this is a full / extended version of a published paper).

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash title}} to define the title.
There are a number \emph{optional} options to {\tt \textbackslash{}title}:

\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
{\tt running} & The running title displayed in the headers.\\
{\tt onclick} & Define what to do when clicking on the title. This could be used to point to a webpage associated with this paper. \\
{\tt subtitle} & Provide a subtitle.\\
\end{tabular}

An example using all the optional options would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\title[running={IACR Communications in Cryptology Class},
       onclick={https://github.com/IACR/latex},
       subtitle={A Template}
      ]{How to Use the IACR Communications in Cryptology Class}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash addauthor}} to define the author list.

Authors are listed individually using the {\tt \textbackslash{}author} command. 
There are a number \emph{optional} options to {\tt \textbackslash{}addauthor}:

\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
{\tt inst} & A numerical list pointing to the index of the institutaion in the affiliation array.\\
{\tt orcid} & Create a small clickable orcid logo next to the authors name looking like \orcidlink{0000-0003-1010-8157} and linking to the authors ORCID iD (see: \url{https://orcid.org}.\\
{\tt footnote} & Create an author-specific footnote.\\
{\tt onclick} & Define what to do when clicking on the author name: e.g.,~can point to the academic webpage.\\
\end{tabular}

\noindent Moreover, one can utilize the {\tt \textbackslash{}surname} macro to indicate what part of the author name is the surname:
this is used for meta-data collection and is especially useful for cases with middle names \emph{and} double 
surnames which might be confusing. 

An example using all the optional options would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\author[orcid=0000-0003-1010-8157,
        inst={1,2},
        footnote={Thanks to my supervisor for the support.},
        onclick={https://www.mypersonalwebpage.com}
       ]{Alice \surname{Accomplished}}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash{}affiliations}}
Affiliations are listed individually using the {\tt \textbackslash{}affiliations} command \emph{after}
the (list of) authors using {\tt \textbackslash{}addauthor}.
There are a number \emph{optional} options to {\tt \textbackslash{}affiliation}:

\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}p{0.7\linewidth}}
{\tt ror} & Provide the Research Organization Registry (ROR) indetifier for this affiliation (see: \url{https://ror.org}). This is used for meta-data collection only.\\
{\tt onclick} & Define what to do when clicking on the affiliation name: e.g.,~can point to the affiliation webpage.\\
\end{tabular}

An example using all the optional options would look like:

\begin{verbatim}
\affiliation[ror=05f950310,
             onclick={http://www.kuleuven.be/english}
            ]{KU Leuven}
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash keywords}} to give a list of
keywords.

Individual keywords should be separated by the \verb+\and+ macro.

If there are fragile commands in the keywords, use the optional argument
to give a text-only version of the keywords; this will be used for the
PDF metadata.

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash email}} should be used inside the
\verb+\institute+ argument to typeset author's email address(es).  An
optional argument can be given for the hyperlink, if different from the
displayed email.  For instance, you can group emails as follows:\\
\verb+\email[alice@foo.com,bob@bob.com]{{alice,bob}@foo.com}+

\paragraph{\texttt{\textbackslash maketitle}} is used to actually
typeset the title.

\paragraph{The \texttt{abstract} environment} should be used to typeset the abstract.

Note that the keywords should be given before starting the abstract environment.


\subsection{Theorems}

The \texttt{iacrtrans} class uses the \AmS{} packages to typeset
math.  In particular, it loads the \texttt{amsthm} package, and
predefines the following environments:
\begin{center}
  \ttfamily
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1cm}}l@{\hspace{1cm}}l}
theorem     & definition & remark \\
proposition & example    & note   \\
problem     & exercise   & case   \\
lemma       & property   &        \\
conjecture  & question   &        \\
corollary   & solution   &        \\
claim       &            &        \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Note that the \texttt{proof} environment automatically adds a QED
symbol at the end of the proof.
If the QED symbol
is typeset at a wrong position, you can force its position with
\verb+\qedhere+.

\section{Class options}
\label{sec:options}

\subsection{Publication type}

The class supports four publication types, selected with the
following class options:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{[final]}] for final papers
\item[\texttt{[preprint]}] for preprints (without copyright info, default)
\item[\texttt{[submission]}] for submissions (anonymous, with line numbers)
\end{description}
Some types supports further options:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{[notanonymous]}] can be used in submission mode, when the
  call for paper requires non-anonymous submissions.
\end{description}

\subsection{Other Options}

\paragraph{\texttt{[floatrow]}}
uses the \texttt{floatrow} package to customize floats rather than the
plain \texttt{float} package.  In particular, this allows to typeset
floats side by side as shown in this example:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[floatrow]{iacrtrans}
\usepackage[demo]{graphicx}
\begin{document}

\begin{figure}
  \begin{floatrow}
    \ffigbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{1.png}}
    {\caption{This is caption 1.}}
    \ffigbox{\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{2.png}}
    {\caption{This is caption 2.}}
  \end{floatrow}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

The row will be divided equally according to the number of figures, but
you can ask each figure to take its natural space instead with
\verb+\ffigbox[\FBwidth]+.  For more advanced use, see the
\texttt{floatrow} documentation.

\paragraph{\texttt{[xcolor=$\langle\text{\emph{list of options}}\rangle$]}}
passes $\langle\text{\emph{list of options}}\rangle$ to the
\texttt{xcolor} package.  Since \texttt{xcolor} is loaded by the class,
you have to use this mechanism to pass options at load time; for instance
use \texttt{xcolor=svgnames} to load SVG color names.


\paragraph{\texttt{[hyperref=$\langle\text{\emph{list of options}}\rangle$]}}
passes $\langle\text{\emph{list of options}}\rangle$ to the
\texttt{hyperref} package.  Alternatively, you can load
\texttt{hyperref} yourself with the required options and the class will
detect that it already loaded.

\paragraph{\texttt{[nohyperref]}}
disables the automatic loading of
\texttt{hyperref}.  Use this is if your document fails to compile with
\texttt{hyperref} for some reason.

The \texttt{iacrtrans} class automatically loads \texttt{hyperref}
after all other packages.  If you need some packages to be loaded
\emph{after} \texttt{hyperref}, you should load \texttt{hyperref}
explicitly at the correct position, but not use the \texttt{[nohyperref]} option.

\paragraph{\texttt{[nolastpage]}}
disables the automatic loading the \texttt{lastpage} package in
\texttt{[final]} mode.  When this option is enabled, the last page
number must be set explicitly with
\texttt{\textbackslash{}setlastpage}.

\section{Typesetting the Bibliography}
\label{sec:biblio}

% Borrowed from btxdoc.tex
\def\BibTeX{{\rm B\kern-.05em{\sc i\kern-.025em b}\kern-.08em
    T\kern-.1667em\lower.7ex\hbox{E}\kern-.125emX}}

Having good bibliographic references is very important for the
visibility of the journal.  Since we don't have a commercial editor,
authors need to make sure themselves that references are standardized
and clean.  We strongly encourage authors to use \BibTeX{} for the
bibliograpy, using bibliographic data
from \url{http://www.dblp.org} or \url{https://cryptobib.di.ens.fr/}.

We are still working on a good solution for the bibliography, and we
expect to have more specific instructions when producing the final
version of the papers, including a dedicated \BibTeX{} style.

\section{Further instructions}

\paragraph{\LaTeX{} distribution, and worklow.}  \LaTeX{}
distributions are available on a variaty of platforms.  In particular,
we recommand the \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}
distribution, which is updated regularly, include a large number of
packages, and is available on many platforms.
\begin{description}
\item[Linux:] A LaTeX installation is included in most Linux
  distributions.  Alternatively,
  \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live} can be installed
  easily without root access.
\item[Windows:] There are also good \LaTeX{} distributions for Windows,
  such as \href{http://www.miktex.org/}{MikTeX} and
  \href{https://www.tug.org/texlive/}{TeX Live}.
\item[MacOSX:] On MacOSX, TeX Live is available inside
  \href{http://www.tug.org/mactex/}{MacTeX}.
\end{description}


We recommand the use of \texttt{pdflatex} because it generally
supports more features than \texttt{latex} and \texttt{dvips}
(\texttt{xelatex} and \texttt{lualatex} are also missing some advanced
features from \texttt{pdflatex}).

\paragraph{Internal references.}

We recommend the use of \verb+\autoref+ from \texttt{hyperref}
(automatically loaded by the class).  For instance,
\verb+\autoref{sec:options}+ links to \autoref{sec:options}.

\paragraph{Pictures.}

We recommend the use of the \texttt{tikz} package to render pictures.

In particular, a large variety of crypto pictures made with
\texttt{tikz} is available at \url{http://www.iacr.org/authors/tikz/}.

\paragraph{External pictures.}  The \texttt{graphicx} is loaded by the
class, and is recommended for external figures.

If possible, external figures should be in a vector format: you can
use PDF files when compiling with \texttt{pdflatex}, and EPS files
when compiling with \texttt{latex}, and \texttt{dvips}.  Note that the
\verb+\includegraphics+ command will automatically select a file with
the right extension, so if you write \verb+\includegraphics{figure}+
and have two files \texttt{figure.pdf} and \texttt{figure.eps}, it
should work with both workflow.

\paragraph{Floats.}

Figure captions should be below the figures, and table captions above
the tables.  The \texttt{float} package loaded by the class should
take care of this automatically.  If want to have several figures side
by side, see the \texttt{[floatrow]} option.

\paragraph{Tables.}

We recommend the \texttt{booktabs} package to typeset tables.

\paragraph{Algorithms.}

We recommend the \texttt{algorithm}, \texttt{algorithmcx} packages for
algorithms (in particular, \texttt{algpseudocode} for pseudo-code).


\section{For the Editor}

The following commands should be used by the editor to prepare the final
version:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setfirstpage} to set the first page number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setlastpage} to set the last page number (optional).
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setvolume} to set the volume number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setnumber} to set the edition number.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setDOI} to set the DOI\@.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setPublished} to set the publication date.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setAccepted} to set the notification date.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setRevised} to set the re-submission date for paper that went though major revision.
\item \texttt{\textbackslash{}setReceived} to set the submission date.
\end{itemize}

There is a special \texttt{settings.tosc.tex} file, that sets default values for these commands
and which can be included in the beginning of the main tex file.
